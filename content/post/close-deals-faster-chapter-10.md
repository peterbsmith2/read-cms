Almost every study about how to get leads and develop prospects concludes that referrals are the number-one tactic. Most experts estimate that ereferral-based selling has a conversion rate of at least 50 percent, with many salespeople reporting that they close between 70 and 90 percent retention rate, and about half of all qualified referrals that are properly pursued eventually buy.  
  
The reason referrals can be so effective is simple. A personal recommendation by someone you trust is powerful. The prospect knows and respects the person who gave you the referral and is therefore confident that you can do a good job. Nielsen research indicates that 90 percent of customers trust their peers more than ads. HubSpot agrees that the same applies in B2B sales.  
  
Many companies, including ASHER, get most of their new business from referrals. To close these referrals requires having a robus process. First and foremost, you must be providing your current clients with excellent products and services. Only when you execute flawlessly will a current customer feel comfortable recommending you to a friend or colleague. Delighted clients tell their friends, vendors, and customers about your services and, as you many of them become clients, they will tell more people about you.  
  
Recently I returned a call to a colleague, Jim Bly, found and chairman of Headwaters, an investment bank in Pittsburgh. Jim and I belong to a business network called the Business Growth Alliance. Members often refer their clients to other companies in the alliance. Jim wanted to refer me to the president and CEO of a Midwest distribution company, so he shared her contact information and agreed to participate in a conference call so he could personally introduce me. This type of introduction alwayss help break the ice. After the initial conversation, I worked on building the relationship with Jim's referral. It took fifteen contacts over an equal number of months to make my first sale to her company. Since then she has become one of our major ongoing clients, hiring ASHER to provide aptitude assessments, sales training, sales process improvement workshops, customer service training, strategic planning facilitation, a virtual sales manager and follow-up sales training. We would not have known about this opportunity, nor have been able to pursue it properly without a powerful referral source who was a virtual "insider" (Chapter Three). Since Jim was providing investment banking services to the client, he knew their business extremely well. Once we had perfectly execuded a couple of tasks, the CEO of the company became our insider.  
  
A recent "B2B Special report--Technical Marketing" surveyed buyers on how they most often make the first contact with a seller. Referrals beat out every other method as shown in Illustration 10.1.  
  
Introductions and referrals account for nearly half of initial contacts with prospects. That is the most popular method, surpassing making contacts through organizations and associations, trade shows and events, and viral/word of mouth. Other methods such as direct mail, telemarketing, email campagins, websites, cahnnel partners, advertising, and search-engine optimization (SEO) are somewhat less effective. These techniques are still worth pursuing, but _nothing_ beats the power of a personal referral.  

|Gaining Initial Contact with the Prospect|     |
|--------------------------------|-----|
| Introductions or referrals     | 48% |
| Organizations and associations | 42% |
| Viral/Word-of-Mouth            | 31% |
| Direct Mail                    | 34% |
| Telemarketing                  | 27% |
| Email Campaigns                | 27% |
| Website                        | 24% |
| Channel Partners               | 23% |
| Advertising                    | 21% |

| Social Media                   | 15% |
### Quantiy vs Quality
Elite salespeople approach referrals the same way they do prospecting-- they know they need to focus on qualified referrals. As we learned in Chapter One, quality beats quantity when it comes to your prospect list. Prioritize your referrals into your prospect list and focus your energy toward a limited number of qaulified referrals so you can give each one the attention needed (12 touches) to close.  
  
Unlike traditional prospects, with erferrals the quality issue goes two ways. Yuo not only want to be connected with a strong prospect, but you also want to be introduced in a way that gets their full attention. This is where the hierarchy of referrals comes into play. Suppose you ask me for a referral and I suggest that you call my friend Joe Brown. That is the lowest rung on the referral ladder. I could have been more helpful by giving you his cell number, direct office line, and/or email address. Then you wouldn't need to worry about getting around a gatekeeper, and you could contact the prospect directly. At the next higher level, I would agree to send Joe Brown an email about your offerings and copy you so you could take it from there. Better yet, I could set up a conference call for you, Joe Brown, and me. Finally, at the top of the ladder, I could set up a golf game, lunch, or breakfast meeting for the three of us so we could meet face to face.  

| The referral Hierarchy                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sports event with you, referrer, and prospect                                  |
| Breakfast or lunch with you, referrer, and prospect                            |
| Conference call between you, referrer, and prospect                            |
| Referral email from referrer to prospect touting you and your offerings        |
| Referrer gives you the name, title, and direct contact information of prospect |
| Referrer gives you name and title of prospect                                  |
  
As you climb up the referral hierarchy you can seel the proability of a sale going up. Ask your referral sources to help you reach the highest level with which they are comfortable.
