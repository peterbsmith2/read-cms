Rhetoric is the _enfant terrible_ of the trivium family. Like grammar and logic, it has an ancient pedigree; unlike them, it boasts a rather chequered reputation. At times the infamy even outstrips its ancestry. You cannot, for instance, dismiss someone's speech as 'gramattical' or 'logical,' but let it pack a wallop, and the cry of 'rhetoric!' deafens all. And that is beacuse, from its inception millennia ago, the art of persuasion has been in tension with the truth. And philosophy. For what is to stop a good rhetorician from bending the truth to suit her case? Should rhetoric not make liars and bull-mongers of us all?  
  
The most levelheaded answer ever given to that question remain's Aristotle's. Between hard truth and bold-faced lie, he saw a whole domain--known in his day as the _polis_--where things need to get done and minds to be made up, where we argue about the right course of action, the most accurate account of events, or the good, the bad, and the uglies in charge of our political fates. If probbilities and values are the  main currency in this sphere, then rhetoric and argumentation are its most efficacious tools.  
  
That is why, for centuries, rheotirc was a staple of education in Europe and beyond. IT has very useful skills to teach, which helped invent modern English (Shakespeare), steel a country against a terrible enemy (Churchill), and move multitudes (Martin Luther King Jr.), or simply communicate effectively. So if you ever wondered about the subtle power that wins over hearts and minds, this little book is for you. And if you never did, it will get you started. For nothing may corrupt like power, but who wants to be powerless in the public sphere?
