> The next morning I was to speak at the NSA's X-1 department. Sure enough, they'd prepared a list of questions, and asked me to concentrate on the following themes:

> 1. How was the penetrator tracked?
> 2. What auditing features exist?
> 3. How to audit someone with system-level privilege?
> 4. Supply technical details on how to penetrate computers.
> 5. How were passwords obtained for the Livermore Crays?
> 6. How were super-user privileges obtained?
> 7. Did the penetrator guard against detection?

> I stared at these questions, and gulped. Oh, I understood what the NSA folks were asking me, but there was something wrong here.  
> Was it that the answers to these questions could be used to break into systems? No, that wasn't my objection. They covered essentially defensive topics.  
> Or did I object to NSA's role of gathering information but not sharing it with anyone else? No, not really. I had resigned myself to that.  
> Reading them a third time, I sensed that they showed an underlying assumption that I found offensive. I scratched my head, wondering what was annoying me.  
> Finally I realized what galled me about their questions.  
> It wasn't the content of the questions, it was their intrinsic neutrality. They assumed an impersonal adversary--a sanitized "penetrator." They implied taht this was an emotionless, technical problem, to be solved by purely technical means.
> So long as you think of someone ripping you off as a "penetrator," you'lll never make any progress. As long as they remained impersonal and detached, the NSA people would never realize that this wasn't just a computer being penetrated, but was a commmunity being attacked.  
> As a scientist, I understood the importance of remaining detached from an experiment. But I'd never solve the problem until I got involved; until I worried about the cancer patients who might be injured by this guy; until I became angry that this hacker was directly threatening all of us.  
> I rephrased the questions and scribbled a new viewgraph:  
  
> 1. How does this scoundrel break into computers?
> 2. Which systems does he slither into?  
> 3. How did this bastard become super-user?  
> 4. How did the louse get passwords to the Livermore Cray?  
> 5. Did the skunk guard against detection?  
> 6. Can you audit a varmint who's system manager?  
> 7. How do you trace an egg sucker back to his roost?  
  
> Now _those_ questions, I can answer.  
  
> These NSA spooks spoke in morally null jargon, while I felt genuine outrage. Outrage that I was wasting my time following a vandal instead of doing astrophysics. Outrage that this spy was grabbing sensitive information with impunity. Outrage that my government didn't give a damn.  
> So how do you pump up a bunch of technocrats when you're a long-haired astronomer without a tie? Or without any security clearance? (There must be some rule like, "No suit, no shoes, no clearance.") I did my best, but I'm afraid that the NSA people were more interested in the technology than any ethical implications.
