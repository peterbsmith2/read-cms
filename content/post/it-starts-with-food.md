> Pg 117: Legumes include all types of beans, peas, lentils, and peanuts (which are not actaully a "nut" at all)

> Now remember--we are not afraid of carbohydrate, nor do we know of anyone who has suffered metabolic catastrophe by eating too many carbohydrates from black beans!

> As with grains, ancient cultures that consumed legumes as a major food source had ways of mitigating some of the issues with legumes, such as rinsing, sprouting, prolonged soaking and cooking, and fermentation.

> In other legumes [other than peanuts] (like black beans or kidney beans), these lectins are destroyed during the cooking process, rendering them harmless.

> It's worth noting, however, that in improperly cooked legumes (such as those cooked in a slow cooker at a lower temperature), lectins may not be completely broken down--and that could result in severe gastrointestinal distress.
