> Impeachments are political trials. Here is the entirety of the Constitution's statement on that subject:

>> Article II, Section 4: The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

>> Article I, Section 3: The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present.  
> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

> But President Tump, who has begun his time of authority so well--his proposed appointments, though not without some controversy, are generally superb--is not likely to casually tempt the impeachment gods. He knows the history here. He will self-regulate.

> It is his closest poltical aides--his most loyal, longest-serving aides--who would cause the ground underneath him to crumble. "He stood on pinnacles that dissolved into precipice," Dr. Kissinger said of Richard Nixon at the late president's funeral. "he achieved greatly, and he suffered deeply." This eulogy is a warning to Trump a caution that Gerry Ford, like Mike Pence, was a welcome midwestern alternative to too much drama and too much abuse of power. The people have their limits. As does the Congress.
