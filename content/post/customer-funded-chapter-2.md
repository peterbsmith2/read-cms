## Quotes

Pg. 50:
> Sales remained slow, and the typically gloomy Bay Area Decemeber weather didn't help. But one morning the phone rang, from The John Gambling Show on WOR Radio in New York. Patricia was, to her considerable surprise, on the air! Gambling wanted to know where they got the unusual items, why there were no hoods on the Italian camouflage jackets, and much more. Drawing on Mel's creative catalog copy, and embellishing it further, Patricia sang and danced her way through a 20-minute interview, which ended with Gambling asking how his listeners in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut could get hteir hands on a copy of Banana Republic catalog number one. "All they need to do is send a dollar to post office box seven seventy four in Mill Valley California, nine four nine four two," she replied. Four days later, the mailman showed up with two large sacks of mail from the post office across the street--it wouldn't fit into the mailbox, so he had to bring it over. There were nearly a thousand enveloples, each one containing a catalog request and a dollar bill.  
>  
> Mail order wisdom indicated that it was impossible ot make money on one's early mailings, but the Zieglers had broken the rule: They were more than covering the cost of the catalog and its postage with the dollar they charge. Banana Republic's catalog business was on its way, with customers paying for the catalog in advance--never mind the merchandise, for which pay-in-advance orders soon followed, too. **Give your customers something inventive and compelling enough, and they will pay--in advance!--to get it.**
  
Pg. 54:
> Thus, there are two sides to the customer-funded coin. One side is getting the customer to pay as early as possible... The other side of the coin is to get your suppliers to let you pay them as late as possible.
>  
> These two sides of the customer-funded coin are the fundamental principles underlying each of the five customer-funded models explored in this book. Call the result "sitting on the float" if you like. Get paid up front, or as early as you can, and pay your suppliers as late as you can.
