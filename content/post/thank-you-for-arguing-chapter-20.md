> By mimicking the mother-in-law right down to her eccentric pronunciation of "school," the husband employs a time-honored technique that brings his audience inside the joke while distancing the victim. The wife laughs; she loves that he knows her mother well enough for a dead-on, yet gentle, imitation. That brings the couple closer together, tightening the circle around the two of them. And it induces the wife to unconsciously leave her mother outside it.

> For one thing, overuse of identity leads to groupthink--where bonding, rather than the "advantageous," governs decisions. This is the danger of arguing demonstratively, in the present tense. If the aim is identity, then the whole point of persuasion is to make everyone eager to belong-- the ultimate source of yes-men and -women.
