> Following are seven of Schiller's techniques that Jobs himself would surely have used had he given the keynote:

> **Create Twitter-like headlines.** Schiller set the theme of the day right up front. "Today is all about the Mac," he told the audience.  
  
> **Draw a road map.** Schiller verbally outlined a simple agenda at the beginning   of his presentation and provided verbal reminders along the way.
  
> **Dress up numbers.** As his boss does, Schiller added meaning to numbers. He told the audience that 3.4 million customers visit an Apple store every week.To give his audience a relevant perspective, Schiller said, "That's onen hundred Macworlds each and every week."  
  
> **Stage the presentation with props.** Demonstartions play a prominent role in every Steve Jobs presentation. Schiller also used the techniuqe smoothly and effectively. As Jobs likely would have done had he given the presentation, Schiller sat down at a computer on the stage and demonstrated several new features that come standard in '09 versions of iLife and iWork.  
  
> **Share the stage.** Schiller did not hog the spotlight. He shared the stage with employees who had more experience in areas that were relevant in the new products he introduced.   
  
> **Create visual slides.** There are very few words on a Steve Jobs slide, and there were few on Schiller's slides as well. The first few slides had no words at all, simply photographs.  
  
> **Deliver a "holy shit" moment.** In true Steve Jobs fashion, Schiller surprised the audience by announcing "just one more thing" to close his presentation. He applied the rule of three as he done earlier, but this time to iTunes. He said there were three new things for iTunes in 2009: a change to the pricing structure, the ability of iPhone customers to download and buy songs on their 3G cellular network, and the fact that all iTunes songs would be DRM free (i.e., without copy protection). Schiller recceived a big round of applause when he announced that eight million songs would be DRM free "starting today" and got an even bigger round of applause when he said that all ten million songs on iTunes would be DRM free by the end of the quarter. Schiller knew that DRM-free songs in iTunes would be the big headline of the day, and he saved it for last. The announcement did, indeed, dominate the news coverage that followed.
