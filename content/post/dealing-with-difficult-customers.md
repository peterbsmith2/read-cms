### Start Small, But Start!
It will probably not surprise you to read that when we talked to organizations about getting better at dealing with their dissatisfied customers, our first question was invariably, "What are the five most common negative customer scenarios that your organization has dealt with in the past quarter and in the past year?"  
  
Nine times out of 10, the answer to this question is, "We have no idea." No idea, really?  
  
I bring this up not to shame anybody, but simply to acknowledge that for most organizations, any information will be better than what they have now.  
  
Our first recommendation in these cases is to identify the smallest piece of information which, if you had it, would allow you to make better decisions in any area related to dealing with difficult customers (or as related to internal benchmarking, how you're contributing to creating dissatisfied customers).  
  
What this piece of infromation is may vary wildly between industries, and even in companies within the same industry. Here are some examples of the minimum information content that was implemented as a first step by some clients:  
- Minutes per month per employee spent roleplaying difficult situations with their managers to prepare for likely (or unlikely but high impact) customer service scenarios.
- Ratio of time spent learning new material to time spent in review of previously taught material per employee.
- Number of customer service incidents per store.
- Ratio of incidents per location to succesfully resolved incidents per location.  
...  
  
### Have a Plan to Handle Resistance
...  
  
Let's consider our example of asking all front-facing staff to recrod any interactions with dissatisfied customers. We may ask them to record the following information:  
1. Customer Name.
2. Reason for customer dissatisfaction. 
3. Whether this issue was resolved on the spot. 
4. Short description of the incident and what the resolution was (or what steps are being taken to resolve it).  
  
If we have all this information, we can look at any number of trends through time. For example:  
- How many incidents did Jane resolve on the spot this month vs. three months ago?
- How many negative incidents di this store record this month vs. last month? Is it increasing or decreasing?
- Did the training we gave in March impact the resolution of incidents in April and May? Did the effect last through the summer? (In other words, how effective was the training?)
- Who are our "problem customers" who have incidents spanning many agents and locations?  
- What is the biggest reason for negative incidents, and what can we do to help prevent those?
