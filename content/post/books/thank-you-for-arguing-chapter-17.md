###### Argument Tool: "THAT DEPENDS": A trustworthy persuader matches her advice with the particular circumstances instead of applying a one-size-fits-all rule.

> _*Phronesis*_, or practical widsom

> Check out the candidate's disinterest, virtue, and _phronesis_-their caring, cause, and craft-and you can make a reasonable prediction about how they will vote once they're in office.

###### Argument Tool: "COMPARABLE EXPERIENCE": The practically wise persuader shows examples from his own life.

> _Phronesis_ makes an especially good persuasion deetector when you don't know where the sweet spot is--when you know too little about an issue, or have no idea what you want to spend. To determine whether you can trust the speaker's judgment, ask: has the guy figured out your needs--your real needs, that is? One of the most important traits of practical wisdom is "sussing" ability--the knack of determining what the issue is really about. Ideally, you want a pathologist like Greg House, the doctor on TV with the worst bedside manner in history. House homes in on the patient's real problem, and he does it with an infallible accuracy that can come only from scriptwriters. In one episode a patient with bright orange skin comes in complaining of back spasms.
> [dialogue from TV show omitted]
> The patient defines the issue as back spasms from a golf injury. House produces a bigger issue: any wife who doesn't notice her husband turn into a carrot must be cheating on him. While the American Medical Association might not appreciate his Sherlockian deduction, House shows the greatest _phronesis_ abilities a persuader can have: to figure out what the audience really needs, and what the issue really is.

###### Argument Tool: "SUSSING OUT THE REAL ISSUE": A trustworthy persuader sees your actual needs even if you haven't mentioned them.
