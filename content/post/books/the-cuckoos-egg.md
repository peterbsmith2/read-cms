The next morning I was to speak at the NSA's X-1 department. Sure enough, they'd prepared a list of questions, and asked me to concentrate on the following themes:

1. How was the penetrator tracked?
2. What auditing features exist?
3. How to audit someone with system-level privilege?
4. Supply technical details on how to penetrate computers.
5. How were passwords obtained for the Livermore Crays?
6. How were super-user privileges obtained?
7. Did the penetrator guard against detection?

I stared at these questions, and gulped. Oh, I understood what the NSA folks were asking me, but there was something wrong here.  
Was it that the answers to these questions could be used to break into systems? No, that wasn't my objection. They covered essentially defensive topics.  
Or did I object to NSA's role of gathering information but not sharing it with anyone else? No, not really. I had resigned myself to that.  
Reading them a third time, I sensed that they showed an underlying assumption that I found offensive. I scratched my head, wondering what was annoying me.  
Finally I realized what galled me about their questions.  
It wasn't the content of the questions, it was their intrinsic neutrality. They assumed an impersonal adversary--a sanitized "penetrator." They implied taht this was an emotionless, technical problem, to be solved by purely technical means.
So long as you think of someone ripping you off as a "penetrator," you'lll never make any progress. As long as they remained impersonal and detached, the NSA people would never realize that this wasn't just a computer being penetrated, but was a commmunity being attacked.  
As a scientist, I understood the importance of remaining detached from an experiment. But I'd never solve the problem until I got involved; until I worried about the cancer patients who might be injured by this guy; until I became angry that this hacker was directly threatening all of us.  
I rephrased the questions and scribbled a new viewgraph:  
  
1. How does this scoundrel break into computers?
2. Which systems does he slither into?  
3. How did this bastard become super-user?  
4. How did the louse get passwords to the Livermore Cray?  
5. Did the skunk guard against detection?  
6. Can you audit a varmint who's system manager?  
7. How do you trace an egg sucker back to his roost?  
  
Now _those_ questions, I can answer.  
  
These NSA spooks spoke in morally null jargon, while I felt genuine outrage. Outrage that I was wasting my time following a vandal instead of doing astrophysics. Outrage that this spy was grabbing sensitive information with impunity. Outrage that my government didn't give a damn.  
So how do you pump up a bunch of technocrats when you're a long-haired astronomer without a tie? Or without any security clearance? (There must be some rule like, "No suit, no shoes, no clearance.") I did my best, but I'm afraid that the NSA people were more interested in the technology than any ethical implications.
