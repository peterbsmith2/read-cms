> He [Jack Abraham, Thiel Fellowship's leader] advised founders not to alert the government about their companies without absolutely needing to do so.

> But for now, Heather, forty-six, was talking about the egg lobby. She was in the middle of fighting it--on behalf of the tech industry. In the past year, she had made over $7 million from lobbying, and hundreds of thousands of that had come from tech companies such as Snapchat, Zocdoc, Fitbit, and SpaceX. She was also representing a new food-tech company called Hampton Creek, whose product Just Mayo was enraging the egg lobby because it didn't contain eggs, yet claimed to be mayonnaise.

> Lately, these lobbyists for incumbents such as the taxi and limousine commissions, the egg lobby, the meat lobby, and the auto dealers, to name a few, were becoming more aware of these upstart start-ups earlier and earlier. It was a reason that Podesta suggested companies hire her as soon as possible.

> He [Bradley Tusk] became familiar with the Chicago lottery system and decided he would figure out a way to make it more profitable and broadly appealing. So he took his idea to all of the big investment banks, saying that he wanted to build a business to privatize state lotteries.

> One day in 2012, Tusk got a call from a small transportation start-up that the government was trying to shut down. It was Kalanick, who told him that he couldn't afford Tusk's fee but would pay him instead with stock. Tusk Strategies turned into Uber's first government relations department. It would run campaigns against city officials, such as New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, who wanted to support entrenched interests such as taxi medallions and limousines.

> Tusk enjoyed the fight. "We basically just kicked the shit out of the mayor and the taxi industry until they backed down," he remembered of his fight on behalf of Uber during the summer of 2015.

> Every morning, each client was emailed a detailed strategy listing all the tactics that would be used that day.

> "Our view is unless we're bringing the intensity of a political campaign, nothing gets done," he [Tusk] said.

> For now, Tusk was thinking of the short term. He wanted to make sure that each of his companies could still operate, and then he would worry about the laws that would keep them in business in the long term. He hoped to someday influence the laws around self-driving cars, as well as shape public opinion about them.

> Otherwise, Tusk said, he tried to avoid young seed-stage companies. He would instead wait until the company was big enough to need him to mount a fight. A company needed time to grow and then later mobilize an enthusiastic customer base so he could get the job done.
