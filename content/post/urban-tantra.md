This version of the Erotic Awakening Massage has the same structure as any other Tantric ritual, with one slight modification. First, you'll set the stage for your massage. Next, instead of chilling out and warming up, you'll come together with your partner so that you can both share any thoughts, feelings, or agreements that need to be spoken before the massage actually begins. The chill out and warm up portion of the ritual is a luxurious sensual massage followed by the first of the genital strokes. This soon intensifies into rock and roll as the genital strokes become more specifically arousing. Finally, following a Clench and Hold, the receiver enters a long afterglow fille with endless possibilities.
