You may have heard salespeople described as hunters or farmers. Hunters dedicate most of their time to finding new prospects and closing them. Farmers prefer to execute brilliantly for the new customer, develop strong client relationships and seek out additional opportunities with them. Once you have closed the business, you have ceased being a hunter with that particular customer. At this point, companies handle the proper care and feeding of the new clients in one of several ways:  
- **The hunter may now assume the role of a farmer,** taking care of the customer, executing flawlessly, doing a great job of delivering appropriate products and services. This model is typical for startups and small businesses and does not scale well. It requires hunters to have customer support skills, which few do. Eventually, the salesperson is no longer hunting and just servicing accounts. This means that to grow, the company has to hire more hunter/farmers -- commodity in very short supply.
- **The hunter has a customer support person providing support.** That is how it works at ASHER. After I acquire a new customer, one of our account managers handles the day-to-day operations of supporting the customer. The customer knows to call them if there is a problem, issue, or request for information of any sort. I will check in periodically with the customer. This support process is typically used when there are just a few large accounts.  
- **The hunt may totally hand off the account management responsibility to an account manager** who takes over and delivers, while the hunter moves on to other opportunities with new prospects.  
- **In some cases, a bank of customer service people handles all aspects of customer support.**
- **The personality style of the hunter salesperson can also influence how a newly closed account is handled.** Directive driver and reflective thinker styles aren't well-suited fro ongoing customer support, so hunters with these personality styles will typically turn over the new account to a support person with a supportive helper or expressive communicator personality style. These two high empathy personality styles are well-suited for the account management role.

### Empower Your Customer Support People to Fix Customer Problems Immediately
Many excellent companies empower sales and customer service people to take care of problems that arise by allowing them to spend money up to a certain level to fix problems right away without asking management. Once again, the Ritz Carlton hotel chain is a great example. One of our associates began working at the Ritz Carlton in West Palm Beach, Florida, 22 years ago, after she graduated from college. She started as a server trainee and worked her way up through a customer-service job to customer-service manager, and then to a senior position in human resources.  
Even in her early, low-level positions at Ritz Carlton, the company's policies and processes empowered her to make sure that customers were delighted. Every employee had the authority to spend up to $2,000 without management approval to right any customer wrong immediately.  
One of our clients decided after our training that they could immediately empower their customer service reps and account managers to spend up to 10 percent of the customer invoice to solve a customer problem immediately. They reasoned that since 10 percent was their average net margin, they would cheerfully give up their profit on any sale to make the customer happy immediately. You may want to ask your manager what spending limit is available to immediately address issues for your customers.  
Ideally, your company will allow latitude up to a limit for you to take the initiative without needing a manager's sign off. Needing approval is not only demoralizing for account managers; it can also feel off-putting to customers. Imagine how you felt after negotiating all the details with the car salesperson, only to be asked to wait for him to get his manager's approval and then the manager wanted to change the deal!  
  
...  
  
As mentioned at the start of this chapter, for companies selling B2B, 90 percent of your business next year will come from your current customers, 75 percent coming from ongoing business with current customers and 15 percent from up and cross selling to them.  
  
So far we've covered three convcepts that are important to managing the opportunity to renew contracts with your customers and setting you up for up sell and cross sell opportunities. These are:  
1. Do a brilliant job for the customer. Execute flawlessly. 
2. Build a long-term relationship with your customer and turn them into an insider for you for life.
3. Execute a formal customer feedback process.
  
The fourth process elite salespeople execute is to up sell and cross sell is to identify these opportunities and give them the focus they deserve. This technique is executed with opportunity charts. Most top tier account managers have a responsibility to up sell (sell more of what the customer is buying), cross sell (sell the customer new products and services) and, whenever appropriate, renew contracts. Average account managers focus on the contract renewal and don't have a process for identifying the up sell and cross sell opportunities.  
  
The elite account managers use opportunity charts to develop a formal, robust disciplined process to up and cross sell (see Illustration 9.3).  
  
Here is how to develop your opportunity chart spreadsheet:  
- Across the top, list your offerings to customers (products and services).
- Down the left hand side, list your current customers. 
- In the spreadsheet, put a check (√) in the boxes where you are currently supplying that product or service to each customer.  
- Put a double check (√√) where there is an opportunity to sell more of that exact same offering to that customer, or perhaps to another division in their company.  
- Put a "not applicable" (n/a) in the boxes where that product or service is just not applicable to that customer.
- In all the remaining boxes, put an (O) or circle for opportunity to cross sell.
  
Then, devise a strategy to up and cross sell to those customers based on your assessment of the data in the opportunity chart. The elite account managers will execute this process once a quarter.
