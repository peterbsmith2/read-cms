### Quotes

Page 2:
> â€¦late into the ES6 specification timeline, suggestions have surfaced that versioning may in the future switch to a year-based schema, such as ES2016 (aka ES7) to refer to whatever version of the specification is finalized before the end of 2016. Some disagree, but ES6 will likely maintain its dominant mindshare over the late-change substitute ES2015. However, ES2016 may in fact signal the new year-based schema.

> There's a great collection of ES6 shims called ["ES6 Shim"](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim/) that you should definitely adopt as a standard part of any new JS project!
