### Quotes

##### WHERE OUTBOUND WORKS BEST--AND WHERE IT FAILS
> If you want to go big with outbound prospecting, it works best when you have these four conditions in place: 
> 1. _You can sell deals that are large enough to be profitable_, usually $10,000-$20,000 in lifetime value (bigger is better). Yes, outbound can work with smaller deals, but it gets much harder to do it profitably.
>
> 2. _Your value proposition is easy for a prospect to understand_ and say yes or no to. If your proposition or messaging is too jargon-ish, not relevant, or if it confuses prospects, you're in trouble.
>
> 3. _You're different_: You can't have 100 competitors selling similar stuff and expect to have easy success with outbound. There's too much noise (i.e. confusion) and prospects can't easily tell why you're better than other options.
>
> 4. _You're not trying to replace other people's stuff_: If you're trying to call in and compete with DropBox or some financial system, to get a company to rip that out and replace it with your service, it's _hard_. You have to have a damn good reason for them to do it--a reason that you're 10x better. It's much easier to look for opportunities where the buyer doesn't need to replace or trash an entrenched system that works "well enough." Whether you call this whitespace, green fields, blue skies, or magenta flowers, look for that kind of market or way to position yourself.

###### When It's Harder
> Outbound prospecting isn't a fit for every company--sometimes it's easier, sometimes harder. Here are some conditions that make it more challenging or less profitable:
> - _It's not a real management priority_: Management hires an intern to dabble, then they forget about it, or they're just too busy to give it time. Or they won't pay for even some basic data or apps you need. (Funny how campanies will spend $5,000 a month on paying someone, but not $50 a month on an app that that person needs!)
> - _You aren't willing to focus your Ideal Outbound Customer Profile_ and you're spraying emails and calls at anyone and everyone with a pulse. Any buyers you run into are encountered mostly through dumb luck. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day, but, really ...
> - _Unrealistic expectations_: "Hey guys, its been 30 days--where are our closed deals?" It takes three to six months to go from scratch to consistent pipeline generation--and longer for revenue, depending on how long your sales cycle is (and outbound cycles _will take longer_ than your inbound cycles.) Stick it out! If you have long sales cycles, you may not see first revenue for a long time, but you will see the regular progress towards it.
> - _The CEO believes all prospecting needs to be done only by salespeople_, and doesn't believe in dedicated prospectors.
> - _You sell custom or commodotized professional services._ Professional services are harder to market and sell than products. You can imporve your odds by going super-narrow with a niche. Be open to doing more testing and it taking longer than you expect. Or accepting that other forms of leadgen will be better, like content marketing or live events.
> - _It's Boiler Room 101:_ Your outbound strategy involves telling the team every day to "make more calls, send more emails"--whether those calls and emails are working or not. It's all about activity, not about what the activities are accomplishing.
>
> The bottom line, though, is that there are companies in every kind of situation that have made prospecting work. But in some cases it's a lot easier than in others to make it a primary growth engine.
