Sometimes copying can be part of the learning process, like when you see an art student replicating a painting in a museum or a drummer playing along to John Bonham's solo on Led Zeppelin's "Moby Dick." When you're a student, this sort of imitation can be a helpful tool on the path to discovering your own voice.  
Unfortunately, copying in the business arena is usually more nefarious. Maybe it's because of the copy-and-paste world we live in these days. You can steal someone's words, images, or code instantly. And that means it's tempting to try to build a business by being a copycat.  
That's a formula for failure, though. The problem with this sort of copying is it skips understanding--and understanding is how you grow. You have to uderstand why something works or why something is the way it is. When you just copy and paste, you miss that. You just repurpose the last layer instead of understanding all the layers underneath.  
So much of the work an original creator puts into something is invisible. It's buried beneath the surface. The copycat doesn't really know why something looks the way it looks or feels the way it feels or reads the way it reads. The copy is a faux finish. It delivers no substance, no understanding, and nothing to base future decisions on.  
Plus, if you're a copycat, you can never keep up. You're always in a passive position. You never lead; you always follow. You give birth to something that's already behind the times--just a knockoff, an inferior version of the original. That's no way to live.  
How do you know if you're copying someone? If someone else is doing the bulk of the work, you're copying. Be influenced, but don't steal.  
### Pick A Fight 
If you think a competitor sucks, say so. When you do that, you'll find that others who agree with you will rally to your side. Being the anti-______ is a great way to differentiate yourself and attract followers.  
For example, Dunkin' Donuts like to position itself as the anti-Starbucks. Its ads mock Starbucks for using "Fritalian" terms instead of small, medium, and large. Another Dunkin' campaign is centered on a taste test in which it beat Starbucks. There's even a site called DunkinBeatStarbucks.com where visitors can send e-cards with statements like "Friends don't let friends drink Starbucks."  
Audi is another example. It's been taking on the old guard of car manufacturers. It puts "old luxury" brands like Rolls-Royce and Mercedes "on  notice" in ads touting Lexus's automatic parking systems with ads that saay Audi drivers know how to park their own cars. Another ad gives side-by-side comparison of BMW and Audi owners: The BMW owner uses the rearview mirror to adjust his hair while the Audi driver uses the mirror to see what's behind him.  
Apple jabs at Microsoft with ads that compare Mac and PC owner, and 7UP bills itself as the Uncola. Under Armour positions itself as Nike for a new generation.  
All these examples show the power and direction you can gain by having a target in your sights. Who do you want to take a shot at?  
You can even pit yourself as the opponent of an entire industry. Dyson's Airblad starts with the premise that the hand-dryer industry is a failure and then sells itself as faster and more hygienic than the others. I Can't Believe It's Not Butter puts its enemy right there in its product name.  
Having an enemy gives you a great story to tell customers, too. Taking a stand always stands out. People get stoked by conflict. They take sides. Passions are ignited. And that's a good way to get people to take notice.
