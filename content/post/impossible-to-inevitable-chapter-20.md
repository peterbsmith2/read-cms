#### Functional Ownership
Someone has Functional Ownership, and the emotional commitment that comes with it, when they, as a single person, _clearly and publicly_ own a slice of how the business works, whether its the P&L for a billion dollar division or the office refrigerator cleaning routine. He or she is 100% responsible for it, including its results, related decisions, and improvement.  
  
People support what they help create--the size of what they own doesn't matter as much as the reality of their ownership. Including an _inability to hide_ from that responsibility, which is why shared responsibility tends to create pointed fingers.  
  
So, Functional Ownership is a key piece of the motivation puzzle here. Then, combine it with inescapable deadlines and Forcing Functions (which we'll get to later in this chapter) â€¦ that's when predictable magic happens.  
  
First of all, there isn't "one thing" that makes all your wishes come true, like some kind of magical sparkly-purple unicorn. And if anyone claims there's "one thing" that will fix all your problems, they're bullshitting you or themselves.  
  
But Functional Ownership can be life-changing for:  
- Employees who want to take their contributions to the next level, but haven't been sure how.  
- Executives who keep looking for ways to predictably motivate and energize people.  
  
It's not going to work for everyone. You'll always have Complainers and Clockers, in addition to your CEO-types and Careerists (we'll describe those further on). But if you directly manage 10 people, and even one or more acts like an owner, it can be transformative. If a manage can go from having zero to even one, or from one to two "employees acting like owners" on their team--_wow_.
