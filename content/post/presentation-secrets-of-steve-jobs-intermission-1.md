Exactly ten minutes into his presentation at Macworld 2007--and not a second more--Jobs revealed a new Apple television commercial for iTunes and iPods (the one with a dark silhouette of people dancing in front of brightly colored backgrounds--the silhouettes are holding iPods, and the stark white earphones noticeably stick out). "Isn't that great?" Jobs said as the commercial ended. Jobs essentially provided an "intermission" between the first act of his presentation (music) and the second (the launch of Apple TV, a product designed to play iTunes content on a widescreen TV).  

Obey the ten-minute rule and give your listeners' brains a break.
