 >> [Tony Orenstein] was a great director...If you're lucky, you have someone when you're young who doesn't talk down to you, who speaks to you as a serious person and exhorts you to take something seriously, to take work seriously. If a person does that in the right way, you feel elevated. As a young person, you feel like someone is saying to you, 'Hey! You want to be taken seriously? Then take things seriously. Do the work, you know? Don't coast, you know?' I'd say that's what she gave.
