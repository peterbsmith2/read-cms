- Never ask for the close with words. Use a buyer's order.
- Never make verbal promises. Put all of your assurances in writing.
- The more data you provide, the better. Don't be afraid to use lots of data.
- Keep your information current.
- Have your written information available and easy to access.
- Use third-party data as much as possible.
- The more you're able to access the data in real time, the better. Real-time data are preferable to prepared data.
- Use computer-generated data whenever possible.
- Have Internet access available so you can pull the data up in front of the customer and he can see that it hasn't been contrived or manipulated.
