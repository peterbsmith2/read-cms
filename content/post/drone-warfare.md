> "On the drive out here, you get yourself ready to enter the compartment of your life that is flying combat," retired Col. Chris Chambliss told the _Los Angeles Times_. "And on the drive home, you get ready for that part of your life that's going to be the soccer game."  
  
> And in between you kill.  
  
> Many people can relate to the banal experience of commuting to and from work and the constant struggle with trying to separate one's time in the office from time spent at home. But for an increasing number of Americans, the process of decompressing after a hard day's work is about more than just trying to forget about expense reports and the petty tyranny of office politices: in many cases, it's about trying to forget the lives you extinguished--and the lives of your comrades you couldn't save.  
  
> In contrast to the traditional notion of the war fighter at an actual battlefield, Col. Chambliss, who was based out of Nevada's Creech Air Force Base about forty minutes outside Las Vegas, could remotely order a Predator drone to fire a Hellfire missile at a group of suspected Taliban thousands of miles away in Afghanistan while,but a few hours later, making it home in time to catch a rerun of _Friends_. And there are thousands more just like him, solides and civilians alike, partaking in the US government's expanded use of UAVs to assassinate perceived enemies on the other side of the globe.   

> In 2004, the Air Force flew just five round-the-clock patrols with Predator and Reaper drones each day; by 2010, that number had reached forty. By 2011 the Air Force was training more remote pilots than fighter and bomber pilots combined. There were about 1,100 drone pilots and 750 sensor operators in the Air Force by the end of 2011. The air Force projected that it would need at least 2,110 pilots and about 1,500 sensor operators to staff its fleet by 2015.  
  
> US Major Bryan Callahan said that drone pilots are taught "early and often" to compartmentalize their lives, to separate the time they spend firing missles on battlefields from the time they spend--the same day--at home with their families. When it comes to witnessing murder, "you need to tuck those things away and put them where they belong," Callahan explains. "We're pretty good at it."  
  
> The trend toward greater autonomy will only increase as the military moves from one pilot remotely flying one drone to one pilot remotely managing several drones at one. "Lethal autonomy is inevitable," said Ronald C. Arkin, who authored a study on the subject for the Army Research Office.  
  
> Arkin believes autonomous drones could be programmed to abide by international law. Others vehemently disagree and question the ethics of robots making life and death decisions.  
  
> But one thing is certain: autonomous weapons won't suffer from PTSD. And that's why --ethical or not--the military will most likely be expanding its dependency on machines that do not possess the troublesome emotions and consciences of its human pilots.
