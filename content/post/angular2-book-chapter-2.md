> As every module the application module is implemented by using a class and attaching the_@NgModule_ decorator as you can see in the code listing. This decorator is imported from _@angular/core_.  

> Every application module needs to import _BrowserModule_. By importing this standard module we get access to browser specific renderers and Angular 2 standard directives like _ngIf_ and _ngFor_.  

> By importing _platformBrowserDynamic_ we get access to the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler which compiles the application in the browser.
