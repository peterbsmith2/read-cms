## Quotes

#### When to apply pay-in-advance models to build a customer-funded business:
Pg. 218:
> _Where there are pockets of truly compelling customer pain:_ The more pressing the customer's pain, whether for goods or services, the more likely the customer will be to pay you in advance, even for a solution that is not yet fully developed.  

Pg. 219:
> _In virtually any B2B setting:_ ...asking prospective B2B customers to pay in advance _always_ makes sense. If you find they are not willing to pay you something in advance, maybe that means they won't be willing to pay you at all, ever! You may be on the wrong track.  

> _In virtually any services business:_ Practically forever, those selling services of every kind have been asking their customers to pay for the service, in part or entirely, up front. Customers are willing to pay, too. So if you're planning to start most any kind of services business, there's no reason why you should need investment captial to get started. Just ask for the order, and ask for payment up front, too. As Brad Feld says, "There's no excuse not to!"  

#### How to apply pay-in-advance models:
Pg. 221:
> _Win customers' confidence and trust:_ No customer will fork over advance money to a provider they don't trust. In a B2B setting, trust and confidencecan be built interpersonally and with references and referrals. For online marketers, it's more difficult to do. Bennett of A Suit that Fits worked hard to generate press clippings, awards, and endorsements on review sites in order to build trust in his early year. Today, social media can carry some of this load.

#### Pay-in-advance models: Prifalls to watch out for:
Pg. 221:
> _The dominant customer_  

> _We want it now_

Pg. 222:
> _Me first!_

> _Forgetting who you are:_ Services businesses often yearn to become product businesses. Why? It's more difficult to scale many services businesses because growing the business means growing (and perhaps training) the service delivery team at a comparable rate. But, as we saw in Chapter 7, service-to-product businesses have their own inherent challenges, and the transition from one to the other is far more difficult than it may appear. Taking your eyes off the ball, in pursuit of a services-to-product transition, is a recipe for potential disaster.

> _Lack of clarity in your vision:_  ...Saying "No" isn't easy when your customers' money is feeding you, but sometimes it's the right thing to do.

> _Customers wanting equity in your business:_ Getting customers to pay up front for what you'll deliver later is a good thing. Getting or allowing them to take an equity stake often is not. Why? Growth capital investor Hillel Zidel of Kennet Partners puts it simply: "We don't like it." Though you may start your business with a customer-funded pay-in-advance model, you may at some point wish to raise institutional capital to fund further product development or faster growth. Future investors may be deterred, however, if your customers have a seat at the board or shareholder table, as their objectives are likely to diverge from those of the investor.

> ..But how can you say "No" if they demand equity? Give them something else: a time-to-market advantage before you sell (at least for a limited time) to their principal competitor; or an exclusive in their field of use, as suggested above. But be sure to do these things in return for firm purchase commitments, of course!

> _Customer A or customer B_:
