## Quotes

> Not only didn't Expedia pay the hotel for your stay until after you arrived--despite the fact that you probably paid Expedia when you booked the room--but in many cases they paid the hotel as many as six weeks _after_ your stay. What is Expedia doing with your money--their customer's money--for all those weeks, or sometimes months? Running and growing their business, of course! "Sitting on the float" with the customers's money is a time-honored principle that runs throughout this book.
  
Pg. 4
> Winning customer orders often gives your customer a vested interest in your success. If they are happy to buy from you, they'll want you to stick around, either so they can buy again later, or so you will service what you've sold. For an entrepreneur, having your customers on your side is a good place to be. For angels, having customers rave about the company in which you are thinking of investing is a very good sign!
  
Pg. 6
> Fifth, focusing your efforts to raise cash from customers who are willing and eager to buy from your yet-unproven company is likely to mercifully put to rest a half-baked or not-quite-right idea that requires more development--a pivot, in today's entrepreneurial lexicon--in order to hit the mark.

Pg. 15 

> Most [customer-funded models] raised institutional capital eventually, and did so once the concept had been proven.
  
Pg. 16
> Experienced investors know that while planning is important, effective implementation is what actually delivers the results.
